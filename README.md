# Open Data Hub Template Project

The Open Data Hub Template Project is a template for starting new projects in the GitHub organizations owned by Open Data Hub. All Open Data Hub projects, at minimum, must have the following files:

- a `README.md` outlining the project goals, sponsoring sig, and community contact information
- an `OWNERS` with the project leads listed as approvers
- a `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining how to contribute to the project
- an unmodified copy of `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` from this repo, which outlines community behavior and the consequences of breaking the code
- a `LICENSE` which must be GPLv3 for code projects, or Creative Commons 4.0 for documentation repositories, without any custom content
